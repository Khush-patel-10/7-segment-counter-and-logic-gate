## How it works

it can be used as a counter as well as basic gates, full adder and full subtractor. For working of basic gates and all we have to give logic high at 3. pin 4 should always be high for both use.

## How to test

give 1hz of clock pulse at pin 0.

## External hardware

leds can be connected for easy visulization of ocuput of adders and subtractors
